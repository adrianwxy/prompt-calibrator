# Prompt Calibrator

> A better way to start every AI conversation.

Most people open ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini and type a quick sentence. They get a mediocre response. 
Not because AI is bad — but because the first prompt was too vague.

Prompt Calibrator guides you through a structured setup and instantly generates a ready-to-use prompt. No prompt engineering knowledge required.
Built as a fully static, zero-backend tool — all prompt generation runs client-side with no data collection by design.

## What It Does

Fill in a few fields. Get a structured, copy-ready prompt in real time.

The tool walks you through four core inputs:

- **Task** — what you want to accomplish
- **AI Role** — who the AI should act as
- **Client / Audience** — industry, company size, and situation context
- **Additional Context** — audience type, deadline, deliverable stage

Optional style preferences let you control tone (concise, formal, conversational) and format (bullet points, prose, step-by-step).

Every generated prompt automatically includes a grounding rule that instructs the AI to acknowledge assumptions, highlight limitations, and never fabricate insights beyond what the data supports.

## Why I Built This

I noticed people around me were underusing AI — not because they lacked interest, but because they didn't know how to start the conversation effectively. A two-sentence prompt gets a two-sentence answer. A structured prompt gets real work done.

This tool removes that barrier for non-technical users.
